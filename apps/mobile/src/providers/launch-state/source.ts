/**
 * Launch State Source — the seam between the in-memory Launch State store and
 * the durable source of truth. #18 ships only the stub below; issue #23 plugs
 * in the real implementation that calls Control Plane `GET /me` and maps the
 * `AccountState` response into a `LaunchState`.
 *
 * Swapping the real source in must require ZERO changes to the resolver or the
 * root layout — that is the whole point of this interface. The contract the
 * resolver assumes (see resolve-launch-state.ts): `signedIn: false`
 * short-circuits regardless of gate fields; `GateStatus` keeps the `skipped`
 * distinction; a `null` gate the resolver needs yields `RESOLVING`.
 *
 * `read` is async now (even though the stub is synchronous underneath) so the
 * real `GET /me` implementation drops in without changing the signature.
